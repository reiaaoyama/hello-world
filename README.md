Hello World Repository for GitHub Guide Exercise

Hi There,

I'm Rei. I am just going through GitHub Guide Exercise.  In this
exercise, I created a branch from the master branch and edit the
README.md file.

## My Goals
I have a couple of goals in mind for 2016. These goals can be
categorized into two main classes: personal enrichment and, career
related. 

For personal enrichment, I am trying to improve my communication
skills. The one that I need to improve is mostly written
communicaiton. My grammar is very bad, especially on the use of
propositions and spelling. The second thing that I want to improve is
presentation skill. 

For career, my goal is to learn more about SDN in general. As to the
use of SDN, there are several things that I could be
learning. Starting from mininet and go all the way to full NFV stacks.
